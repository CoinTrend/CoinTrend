### Lightweight
CoinTrend stores coins' data locally and updates them automatically only when needed, thus minimising network data consumption and battery consumption. You can still manually trigger a data update whenever you need it by simply swiping down on each screen!

### 100% free and open-source
Don't trust, verify! CoinTrend is 100% free and does not include any ads nor trackers. Check the code out yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions!

### Designed for Android
The User Interface has been designed by following the latest Google's Material Design guidelines and by using only native Android components and animations.


## Technical Details

- **100% Jetpack Compose** üöÄ

- **Material Design 3** üíé

- **Multimodule Clean Architecture** üèõ as [davidepanidev](https://github.com/davidepanidev)'s [Clean Architecture Compose Concept](https://github.com/davidepanidev/android-multimodule-architecture-concepts/tree/clean-architecture-compose-concept) which consists of 4 separate modules:
  -  _app_: Android module that contains the Android Application component and all the framework specific configurations. It has visibility over all the other modules and defines the global dependency injection configurations.
  -  _presentation_: Android module **MVVM**-based. It contains the Android UI framework components (Activities, Composables, ViewModels...) and the related resources (e.g. images, strings...). This module just observes data coming from the undelying modules through Kotlin Flows and displays it. 
  -  _domain_: Kotlin module that contains Use Cases (platform-independent business logic), the Entities (platform-independent business models) and the Repository interfaces. It contains the `BaseAutomaticRefreshDataFlowUseCase` which handles the logic to refresh the persisted data when it becomes outdated.
  -  _data_: Android module that acts as the **Single-Source-Of-Truth (SSOT)** of the App. It contains Repositories implementation, the Room Entities for persistence, the data source Api implementations and the corresponding api-specific models.
  
- **Unit Testing** ‚öôÔ∏è of the domain logic using MockK, Strickt and Turbine to test Kotlin Flows.
